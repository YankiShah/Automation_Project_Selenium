# Automation_Project_Selenium

This project is a part of CMPE 287 - Software Quality Assurance and Testing subject.
The Objective of this project is to understand the flow and configuration of Selenium IDE and Webdriver scripts.
I chose www.whythefuzz.com as the client and performed automation test on that client.

The source code includes 10 Scripts including FileUpload, ImageCheck, CoockieCheck, Login and Signup Checks.
